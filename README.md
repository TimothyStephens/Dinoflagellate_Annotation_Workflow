# Dinoflagellate Annotation Workflow

This is a comprehensive workflow for the prediction of protein-coding genes in dinoflagellate genomes. It integrates evidence from multiple sources, including transcriptome, proteome, and other *ab initio* gene prediction tools. 

For more information see:
  - `doc/Install_Programs.txt`: Instructions for installation of tools needed for the workflow.
  - `doc/Mods_to_programs.txt`: Instructions for modifying existing gene prediction tools to accommodate the non-standard splice sites present in dinoflagellates.
  - `doc/Run_Annotation.txt`: Instructions for how to run the workflow (after installation has been completed).
