# Dinoflagellate Annotation Workflow

This is a comprehensive workflow for the prediction of protein-coding genes in dinoflagellate genomes. It integrates evidence from multiple sources, including transcriptome, proteome, and other *ab initio* gene prediction tools. 

For more information see:
  - `doc/Install_Programs.txt`: Instructions for installation of tools needed for the workflow.
  - `doc/Mods_to_programs.txt`: Instructions for modifying existing gene prediction tools to accommodate the non-standard splice sites present in dinoflagellates. Keep in mind that the code of the files to modify might vary slightly from one program version to another. Get in touch if you are uncertain about the edits.
  - `doc/Run_Annotation.txt`: Instructions for how to run the workflow (after installation has been completed).
